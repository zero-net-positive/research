The scope of the Zero Net Positive Initiative is defined as:

* We seek to help build a world that supports a more sustainable, equitable and inspiring direction for all of humanity.
* Companies are the focus of our attention, as we believe their unconstrained power in the 21st century makes them an ideal lever to influence our future.
* Our method is to be creative in the existing system – ‘hacking’ current corporate structures to do a better job for us all than they do now.
* We plan to do this with meaningful definitions that can be clearly evaluated to make clear new classes of companies.
* These reoriented companies must be fundamentally directed towards a more positive vector of progress, while doing no harm to any stakeholder.

In short, our focus is companies, not non-profits/ngo's or government. And we aren't seeking to enact new
legislitation or lobby governments. We want to use the existing legal structures and find tactics to bend them
to more positive ends than just making money.

This project is open for anyone to join, as we research what's come before and build up a knowledge base for
purpose-driven companies. It hopefully builds in to a reference of all the ways people are trying to make
their companies make a better world. And a place where new techniques can incubate and launch, in a network
of like-minded individuals.
