Our new structures will not exist in isolation, and indeed will likely be more interdependent than our 
current institutions. This topic is concerned with how we collectively build the movement to bring about 
this more positive vector of progress. What meta-institutions will help work towards our goals. We will 
survey who is working to spread the ideas in society, and work on new ideas to help advance the causes.


‘Badges’ - An idea we discussed a lot at the ZNP Advance. Let organizations self identify the values they hold,
but have a consistent way to make that identification and create new groups.

‘Guilds’ -  Cross-organization career development organizations. Much to be explored here, but people jump jobs
and don't just work for a big company that plans their training and career advancement. How can we offer an 
alternative. Lots to learn from the freelancer's union here. But also how does this link to networks of 
like-minded people. Like the 4D network, who help eachother out, across different companies. Can we have
a method of lasting mentorship and career development in much more fluid career paths.

B-labs - With B-Corps and Benefit Corporations and other initiatives they are clearly moving not just the
conversation forward - they're creating tools for all to use.

Muhammad Yunus and 'Social Business' - There are several projects and books related to what Yunus is trying to
do, but it's clearly a push for a real societal step forward.

B-Team - Branson's initiative, looks to be taking things on at a societal level.
