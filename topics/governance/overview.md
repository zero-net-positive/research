At the intersection of [legal structures](../legal-structures/overview.md) and [culture](../culture/overview.md)
is how the two interact. The legal structure is how the organization fits in to the tax code and society. The 
governance structure is how the internal culture is manifested to meet its legal obligations, and indeed to 
hopefully go far beyond that. Governance in a company should scale culture and make it sustainable.

Corporate Charter Innovations - building values in to the corporate charter that stay true. 

Supervotes - A way for founders to retain control to stay truer to their mission and vision. Keeps control out
of a pure profit motive that easily arises as the lowest common denominator of for profit shareholders.

Kamikaze clauses - Right now the only way for a company to go out of business is if it runs out of money. This
is true even with 'triple bottom line' businesses - there's only one bottom line that puts them out of business. A
kamikaze clause would end a business for other reasons, like if it didn't meet some baseline environmental or social
obligations.

Planned Sunsetting - Corporations often end up existing far past their original purpose, evolving to be more efficient
money making machines. What if organizations were built to achieve a certain purpose, or operate for a certain amount
of time, and then break up. Have companies work more like Hollywood movies, instead of having the successful ones amass 
capital and continue on to other purposes far from their original goal.

Size limits - Companies like 37Signals have made conscious decisions to stay 
[small](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1068-finding-the-natural-size-for-your-company). Perhaps this is just a mental
experiment, but what if companies formed with limits of how big they could be? They'd split whenever they grew, along
whatever lines they wanted (marketing forms its own consulting company, or two product teams go in to their own companies).

Voting trusts for good - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_trust and have the trust go to a set of people who have
the mission of the company as their first goal, not maximizing profit.

Commitments to donate profits - Like Salesforce's [1-1-1](http://blog.zeronetpositive.org/2013/hybrid-organizations/) and
Google's 1% to Google.org
