The 'Pay It Forward' Corporation is an idea for a company structure that aims to sequester 
capital into an ecosystem for social good. It builds on Muhammed Yunus's concept of a 
[Social Business](http://www.yunussb.com/social-business/), which has a social mission like 
an NGO but covers its costs like a business. In his model investors can recoup their original 
monetary investment but can not take any financial dividend beyond that point – their returns 
are entirely about the 'impact'. The only bottom line is the good the organization does, 
achieving its mission. But it generates its own revenue by competing in the market, instead 
of continually seeking grants and donations.

The 'Pay It Forward' corp aims to instantiate the social business principles into open, freely 
available, 'forkable' legal documents that can be used to incorporate in specific jurisdictions 
(initially the US, but hopefully expanding). While Yunus has focused more on large, slow growth 
businesses our backgrounds are in technology. The Pay It Forward corp will be built with higher 
growth technology business in mind.

The core of the model is that everyone involved agrees to pay forward any financial returns from 
ownership. The entrepreneur has an idea that has a social benefit and can be successful in the 
market. She creates shares and distributes those to early employees and investors. She and everyone 
who directly works for the company can make great salaries and bonuses if successful, with total 
compensation packages competing with startups and huge corporations. But the 'pay it forward shares' 
are not part of that monetary compensation – they can only be used to invest in other Pay It Forward 
corps. The initial investor and entrepreneur will likely continue to reinvest in other entities that 
complement the mission. Individuals might build up a good amount of Pay It Forward capital in one job 
to be able to start their own Pay It Forward corp focused on something their more passionate about.

We see the biggest potential for the model in sectors where government control and full privatization 
have both failed to achieve the best outcomes for society. Health care, education, government services 
and infrastructure all could be better served by market-driven organizations that solely define their 
success by their impact, not their bottom line. We believe the structure is a natural fit for 
organizations building commons-based peer produced products like open source software and open data.

A core feature of Pay It Forward corporations will be their focus. The mission must be narrowly 
defined and measurable. Economies of scale will be achieved by networks of Pay It Forward companies 
coordinating towards similar ends. When one experiences success and mission creep instead of starting
a new division it will spawn a new entity, retaining its Pay It Forward shares to continue to 
fulfill its mission. Through this we see arising networks of aligned organizations that are each 
small and agile, and each very focused on their particular mission. These will live and die in the 
market, and successful ones will spawn new nodes in the network.

One benefit of larger companies is the building of a brand, but we believe we could achieve the same 
thing with the network. There are already brands like [4G LTE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution), 
[Sunkist](http://www.sunkist.com/about/cooperative.aspx), [True Value Hardware](http://truevaluecompany.com/about_true_value/company-overview.asp), 
[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/foundation/) and many more that are made of up different entities 
in a variety of structures. Each business function could potentially be its own Pay It Forward corporation 
– different organizations that do sales, marketing, program management, design and development, all with 
an aligned mission to build products for an open hospital records infrastructure.

We are just getting started, looking for organizations that are up for experimentation and allies to join 
us in thinking through issues and finding capital to start and sustain some prototype Pay It Forward 
Corporations. Join us in the Zero Net Positive Initiative as we work on this and related ideas to hack 
our system to better outcomes.
