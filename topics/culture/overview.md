Culture is all the day-to-day actions that make a company do good. There are countless companies with 
for profit structures that could put profit above all else, but they don't because the culture is bigger. And
no amount of great structural and governance ideas can work if the culture doesn't align. There are many innovations, 
but for this research we will attempt to constain to those that help society, the environment. We will consider 'in 
scope' innovations that help individuals evolve to be better citizens of the world, as well as things that introduce
less hierarchy and more collaboration.

(TODO: Refine the above, and expand to make it a true overview. May be easier when there's more content.)

Right now it's difficult to list all the potential topics here - we need more research. But there are some great 
sources of inspiration:
